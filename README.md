# MyAlmanack
There are two common problems that college students regularly face: knowing someone else’s schedule (whether it is a friend, groupmate, etc.) and keeping up with their own. Our solution to these two issues is MyAlmanack, a social media website that where a user can have a personal profile containing a certain type of privately-shared calendar that includes a user-created and user-maintained schedule. This will be achieved by having users input and edit their own personal schedule into an online calendar and share/compare their schedule with select other users that they personally “friended” or groups that they created/joined. A user’s online schedule is maintained in their profile with that user being the only person capable of creating, updating, and deleting any information on their calendar. Only people that have been given permission by a user can view that user’s schedule, which means all calendars are not available for reading from the public-eye. Users can also send each other messages or invites to events, but any information included in those objects will not be published or accepted by the receiver unless the receiver gives permission.
